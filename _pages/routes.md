## Routes

The bikepacking and gravel cycling routes highlighted here range from well-known, popular routes that are published and maintained by other organizations, to some lesser known tracks extracted from deep within forgotten cycling forums, or devised by our contributors. For popular routes stewarded by organizations like Vermont Bikepackers, Bikepacking.com, Bikepacking Roots, or Adventure Cycling Association, links and recognition to the originating organization are provided. Please refer to these sites for the most up-to-date information, questions, etc. The routes highlighted here emphasize unpaved, trail, and car-free adventures.

## Overnighters and Multi-day Bikepacking Routes
* [The Bay Circuit Trail, The AMC](https://www.baycircuit.org/)- Approximately 200 miles circumnavigating Greater Boston, camping options on route are limited, but creditcard touring is a viable option.
* [New England's Backyard, Urban Dirt](https://www.urbandirt.org/routes/new-englands-backyard)- Approximately 450 miles through central MA, CT and RI. The route was originally devised as a creditcard tour, but the mapping provided here lists possible camping options.
* [Bos/treal, Boston Cyclist Union](https://bostoncyclistsunion.org/bostreal)- A 400 mile adventure from Boston to Montreal (take the Amtrak back for a car-free adventure!)
* [Mud Pie and Ice Cream Float, Bikepacking Roots](https://bikepackingroots.org/project/sundaes-fundays-ice-cream-float/)- Peri-urban overnighters accessible via public transit on the MBTA. Routes utilize significant rail trail and short sections of singletrack. Short but challenging options for beginners.

## Bikepacking Routes Under Development
Numerous routes are being dreamed up, planned, scouted, and refined. The following list of routes are some that we are most excited about, but haven't thoroughly vetted for rideability, safety, or legality. If you would like to help scout these routes, please reach out, and we can share the status of the route and any other information we have available. We simply ask that in return you provide some feedback about the riding experience. If you are interested in riding one of these routes, know that you do so at your own risk.

## Singletrack-heavy proving grounds
Get sendy with it. These routes are primarily singletrack. Mix and re-mix segments for a choose-your-own type adventure. Lap the technical singletrack as training for your upcoming epics like the Colorado Trail Race or Highland 550. Camping opportunities are limited to the DCR campground in Harold Parker State Forest, and a couple of private campgrounds in the vicinity.
