A call to all bikepackers, dirt-road tourers, and gravel cyclists in Massachusetts and throughout New England: unite! Southern New England might not have the endless gravel roads of Maine, the leg-breaking climbs of Vermont, or the vistas of New Hampshire, but hidden gems abound; you just need to know how to find them.

The Massachusetts Adventure Riding Compendium is the result of some bikepacking nerds in Massachusetts wondering why the 10th largest metro area in the United States didn't have any resources or organized community centered around bikepacking and dirt-road touring. We don't intend for this resource to dismiss or supercede any of the other great guides for bikepacking in New England, but rather we hope it will provide additional helpful information. 

Please consider visiting the websites of other stellar New England Bikepacking Organizations, for links please refer to the <a href="https://bikembarc.com/organizations/">Organizations</a> page.
