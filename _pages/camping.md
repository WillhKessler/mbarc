## Maine

## Massachusetts
Public Lands in Massachusetts are overseen by a patchwork of entities and municipalities including the Federal Government (US Fish and Wildife Service, FWS), the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, cities and towns, and other entities. Each entity has its own rules governing recreation and camping. Before you set out, make sure to familiarize yourself with the rules and regulations governing camping in the areas you plan to ride. 

### Massachusetts DCR properties: 
The Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) oversees the majority of public lands in state which include state forests, state parks, and other conservation lands. Dispersed camping on any of these public lands is broadly prohibitted under state regulation *302 CMR, § 12.08 - Rules of Conduct on DCR Properties - Camping and Campsites* which states that '(1) No person may camp on DCR property, except in a designated campsite, camping structure, or camping area.' However, there are some concessions and accommodations that are made for long-distance hikers and cyclotourists including shelters along established long-distance hiking trails, and the DCR no-turn-away policy. 

Long-distance hiking trails such as the Appalachian Trail (no bikes allowed), the MidState Trail, and others have numerous lean-tos or other strucutres that can be used first-come first-serve and are considered designated camping areas. In addition, Massachusetts DCR has a long standing 'no-turn-away' policy which states that self-contained hikers or cyclotourists who arrive at a reservation only DCR managed camping facility will not be turned away even if the facility is full. Please note that DCR requires you to pay the standard overnight fee even when relying on the no-turn-away policy. You can find a copy of the policy [here]("file:///home/williamkessler/Downloads/MassParks-No-Turn-Away-policy.pdf"), or displayed below. We reccommend that users who are planning to utilize this policy print and carry a copy that can be shared with DCR staff.

### Cities and Towns
Cities and towns across MA maintain forested areas for the enjoyment of their residents and there are no blanket rules governing camping in these areas. We have identified a few locations which indicate camping is allowed with a permit according to the town bylaws. Make sure you plan in advance if you wish to camp in these areas.

## New Hampshire

## Rhode Island

## Vermont
### Vermont State Parks
