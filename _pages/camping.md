Public Lands in Massachusetts are primarily overseen by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) and include state forests, state parks, and other conservation lands. Dispersed camping on any of these public lands is broadly prohibitted under state regulation *302 CMR, § 12.08 - Rules of Conduct on DCR Properties - Camping and Campsites* which states that '(1) No person may camp on DCR property, except in a designated campsite, camping structure, or camping area.' However, there are some concessions and accommodations that are made for long-distance hikers and cyclotourists including shelters along established long-distance hiking trails, and the DCR no-turn-away policy. 
  Long-distance hiking trails such as the Appalachian Trail (no bikes allowed), the MidState Trail, and others have numerous lean-tos or other strucutres that can be used first-come first-serve and are considered designated camping areas. In addition, Massachusetts DCR has a long standing 'no-turn-away' policy which states that self-contained hikers or cyclotourists who arrive at a reservation only DCR managed camping facility will not be turned away even if the facility is full. Please note that DCR requires you to pay the standard overnight fee even when relying on the no-turn-away policy. You can find a copy of the policy [here]("../assets/images/MassParks-No-Turn-Away-policy.pdf"), or displayed below. We reccommend that users who are planning to utilize this policy print and carry a copy that can be shared with DCR staff.
