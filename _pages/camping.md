## Connecticut
### Connecticut DEER properties:

Connecticut has a standing 'No Turn Away' policy for hikers and bikers at DEER campgrounds (state parks/forest campgrounds). A standard CG fee of $14.00 applies. The standing policy is not intended for visitors PLANNING thru hiking or biking trips – they can and should make a reservation, or take advantage of free backpacking sites for thru hikers at some DEER campgrounds. I believe that most people who utilize this policy need a place to stop to sleep for safety reasons, which is why it’s limited to visitors from out-of-state and considered an ‘emergency need’. In emergencies, you/other backpackers would not be turned away from a state campground. However, if it is not an emergency, and you live within 50 miles of the current location, you would be asked to arrange transportation back home.

## Massachusetts
Public Lands in Massachusetts are overseen by a patchwork of entities and municipalities including the Federal Government (US Fish and Wildife Service, FWS), the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, cities and towns, and other entities. Each entity has its own rules governing recreation and camping. Before you set out, make sure to familiarize yourself with the rules and regulations governing camping in the areas you plan to ride. 

### Massachusetts DCR properties: 
The Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) oversees the majority of public lands in state which include state forests, state parks, and other conservation lands. Dispersed camping on any of these public lands is broadly prohibitted under state regulation *302 CMR, § 12.08 - Rules of Conduct on DCR Properties - Camping and Campsites* which states that '(1) No person may camp on DCR property, except in a designated campsite, camping structure, or camping area.' However, there are some concessions and accommodations that are made for long-distance hikers and cyclotourists including shelters along established long-distance hiking trails, and the DCR no-turn-away policy. 

Long-distance hiking trails such as the Appalachian Trail (no bikes allowed), the MidState Trail, and others have numerous lean-tos or other strucutres that can be used first-come first-serve and are considered designated camping areas. In addition, Massachusetts DCR has a long standing 'no-turn-away' policy which states that self-contained hikers or cyclotourists who arrive at a reservation only DCR managed camping facility will not be turned away even if the facility is full. Please note that DCR requires you to pay the standard overnight fee even when relying on the no-turn-away policy. You can find a copy of the policy [here]("file:///home/williamkessler/Downloads/MassParks-No-Turn-Away-policy.pdf"), or displayed below. We reccommend that users who are planning to utilize this policy print and carry a copy that can be shared with DCR staff.

### Cities and Towns
Cities and towns across MA maintain forested areas for the enjoyment of their residents and there are no blanket rules governing camping in these areas. We have identified a few locations which indicate camping is allowed with a permit according to the town bylaws. Make sure you plan in advance if you wish to camp in these areas.

### Vermont State Parks
Reservations can be made:

    Online, 7 days a week
    By phone, Monday–Friday, 9 a.m. – 4 p.m.
    Directly through the park during the operating season

**UPDATE**
Starting February 11, 2026 VT State Parks are updating their camping policies! Changes have been made to the timing of reservation release dates, allowing same-day reservations, allowing one-night reservations, and updating their cancellation policy for all site types.
**Rolling Reservation Window**
Instead of releasing all **reservations on a single day each month, camping reservations will open on a rolling basis daily, 11 months in advance at 9:00 a.m**. This change gives you more chances to book the dates you want—30 or 31 opportunities each month instead of just one. This rolling window applies to all parks. 

**Same day Reservations Available**
Also, you can now make same-day reservations until 2 p.m. on your day of arrival. This update makes it easier to plan a last-minute getaway when sites are available.

**One-Night Reservations Allowed Within 7 Days of Arrival**
To offer more flexibility closer to your trip or for last-minute trips, Reservations made more than 7 days in advance will still require a two-night minimum, but **one-night stays are allowed within 7 days of arrival, any day of the week**
Exceptions: Remote sites at Waterbury Reservoir, Osmore Pond, and Kettle Pond will continue to require a two-night minimum stay.

**Updated Cancellation Policy for Tent, RV, Lean-to, and Cabin Sites**
An updated cancellation timeline has been implemented to better align with neighboring state park systems and improve site availability.
* Cancel 10 or more days before arrival: Full refund, minus the $8 reservation fee
* Cancel 3–9 days before arrival: Refund minus the $8 reservation fee and the cost of one night
* Cancel 0–2 days before arrival: No refund
There are no changes to cottage or shelter reservation policies.

#### Bike Camping specifics:
Vermont State Parks do not require self contained cyclists to adhere to the 2 night minimum reservation requirement for VT state parks. However reservations must be made in advance by calling the park. Campsite availability restrictions still apply. People traveling to VT State Parks (that allow camping) under their own power (hiking, biking, or paddling) or camping in a group camping area may make 1 night reservations. Otherwise there is a 2-night minimum for advance reservations made before March 1 of the current operating season, except for Green River Reservoir. After March 1, 1-night reservations can be made Sunday - Thursday for the current operating season (except for remote sites at Waterbury Reservoir, Osmore Pond and Kettle Pond, which still have minimum stays of 2 nights.
State Forest Primative Camping is also available in some places, general areas are marked on the map with a link to the VT DFPR maps.
