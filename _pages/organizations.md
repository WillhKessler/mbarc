# Adventure Cycling Association
# Bikepacking Roots
# Vermont Bikepackers
Vermont Bikepackers is a volunteer-operated 501(c)(3) nonprofit which seeks to share bikepacking resources across Vermont. 

They chart routes across the state's network of ancient unmaintained roads as well as recreational trails such as rail trails, singletrack, and town forest trails. The paths are already there -- they did not build them, but they do link them together into routes. In some cases, they are working to increase backcountry cycling access across the state. They strive to align with existing initiatives that have community support.

# Adventure Rideworks
Adventure Rideworks is built by cyclists who ride everything - dirt roads, tarmac, singletrack, and the forgotten paths in between. They don’t claim one genre, but have a soft spot for big days, quiet gravel roads and camping under the stars. Their planning and logistics experts love helping riders turn ideas into dialed-in adventures. They obsess over route design, itinerary details, and all the decisions that will turn a good ride into a great one and a great ride into something unforgettable. Located in New England, their specialty is the north east, but have the know how to help you wherever your journey takes you.
